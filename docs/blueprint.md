## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A warm and inviting coral (#FF7F50) to evoke feelings of celebration and connection.
- Background color: A very light peach (#FAF0E6) for a soft, welcoming backdrop that doesn't distract from the card's content.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#70A1AF) to provide a contrasting accent that suggests thoughtfulness and sincerity.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif font for a timeless, elegant feel, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent different card types and actions (download, share, print).
- Ensure a clear and intuitive layout for both template selection and AI prompt customization, with easy access to download/sharing options.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions between steps and to indicate loading or processing, creating a smooth user experience.
